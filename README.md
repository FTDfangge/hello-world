# hello-world
My first repository, I don't even know what to do in this repository.
The first thing I want to do is building a server, a client for Red Alert 3(a game presented by EA).
EA had give up this game years ago, and shut off their official server, of course there are many servers now. But none of them are for Chinese. So I am planning to build one.
I am a builder of RAT. China's biggest communication website of RA3.
But I am new of programing or projecting. I don't even know how to code in C,C++,JAVA,PYTHON,ETC. And I am studying Linux SQL now.
Hope github could give me some help.
